##How to run this program
To run this program you should simply run objDetection.py, to switch between images press any key, on each image there would be placed border box around each ship detected if there were any.
###Model training
For this program I used __YOLO V3__ network and trained it using the Google Colab service for 917 iterations. For simplifing training on images I also used __labelImg__ app.
